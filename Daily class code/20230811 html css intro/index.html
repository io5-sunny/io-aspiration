        Unlike novels, short stories have a finite amount of time to tell a
        tale, introduce characters and themes, and tie it all together in a neat
        proverbial bow. While novels are 200-400 pages on average, short stories
        tell a complete story in 10,000 words or less. They also cut to the
        chase and establish and resolve conflict.
