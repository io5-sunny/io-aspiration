        A well-organized paragraph supports or develops a single controlling
        idea, which is expressed in a sentence called the topic sentence. A
        topic sentence has several important functions: it substantiates or
        supports an essay’s thesis statement; it unifies the content of a
        paragraph and directs the order of the sentences; and it advises the
        reader of the subject to be discussed and how the paragraph will discuss
        it. Readers generally look to the first few sentences in a paragraph to
        determine the subject and perspective of the paragraph. That’s why it’s
        often best to put the topic sentence at the very beginning of the
        paragraph. In some cases, however, it’s more effective to place another
        sentence before the topic sentence—for example, a sentence linking the
        current paragraph to the previous one, or one providing background
        information.
