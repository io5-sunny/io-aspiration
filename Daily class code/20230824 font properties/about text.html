      <blockquote cite="https://www.britannica.com/science/mountain-landform">
        A mountain belt is many tens to hundreds of kilometres wide and hundreds
        to thousands of kilometres long. It stands above the surrounding
        surface, which may be a coastal plain, as along the western Andes in
        northern Chile, or a high plateau, as within and along the Plateau of
        Tibet in southwest China. Mountain ranges or chains extend tens to
        hundreds of kilometres in length. Individual mountains are connected by
        ridges and separated by valleys. Within many mountain belts are
        plateaus, which stand high but contain little relief. Thus, for example,
        the Andes constitute a mountain belt that borders the entire west coast
        of South America; within it are both individual ranges, such as the
        Cordillera Blanca in which lies Peru’s highest peak, Huascarán, and the
        high plateau, the Altiplano, in southern Peru and western Bolivia.
