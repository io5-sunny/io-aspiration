            Turkey has been waging an air war against Kurdish militants in
            northern Iraq. This month, a rash of airstrikes killed seven people,
            including five civilians. Kurdish and Iraqi authorities, not wanting
            to endanger political and economic ties with Turkey, have been
            shamefully silent.
